## Problem to solve

We should make sure operators run fine on edge cases DUM and DEE.

## Idea

* Let's add necessary unit tests.

## Todo list

- [x] project operator
- [x] join and left_join
- [x] matching and not_matching
- [x] image
- [x] restrict, where, exclude
- [x] allbut
- [x] extend
- [x] rename, prefix, suffix, constants
- [x] union, minus, intersect
- [x] summarize
- [x] group, ungroup
- [x] wrap, unwrap, autowrap
- [x] transform
- [x] cross_product (already had tests)
